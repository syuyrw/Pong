# Pong
Try out the first commercailly successful video game that started them all. Pong is a game where two players control paddles that direct a ball to either side of the screen. If the ball gets past one of the paddles and reaches the edge of the screen, the last one to touch the ball recieves a point.

## Getting Started

```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 pong

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.
